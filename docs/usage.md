# How to use MFFCraft

When you try to join server out of nowhere, you will be greeted with this message:

![not white listed](https://github.com/yagarea/minecraft-matfyz/blob/master/docs/not-white-listed.png?raw=true)

To put yourself on whitelist you need to go to page of MFFCraft app. It will look like this:

![MFFCraft homepage](https://github.com/yagarea/minecraft-matfyz/blob/master/docs/step1.png?raw=true)

Now choose your way to authenticate:

> **NOTE**
> Currently only native login works, because CAS login needs to be approved by Charles university per every app using it.
> This is long byrocratic process so this feature is currently WIP.

When you log in, you will be redirected to page where you can add your player name to white list.

![add player](https://github.com/yagarea/minecraft-matfyz/blob/master/docs/step2.png?raw=true)

When player everything worked fine, you will get status message.
